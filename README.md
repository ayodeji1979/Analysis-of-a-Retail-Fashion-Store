# ANALYSIS OF RETAIL FASHION DATASET
This repository contains the file for a comprehensive analysis of a retail fashion dataset. 

## Introduction
The project involved a detailed analysis of a retail fashion dataset, which included two separate datasets sourced from a web platform by a retail fashion company. The primary focus was to gain an insights into their product ratings and customer preferences based on color, price, and brand, providing a detailed understanding of consumer behavior in the fashion domain. This analysis aimed to decipher trends and patterns within the dataset, emphasizing the factors influencing customer choices and satisfaction.

## Key methodologies included:
- Python and Pandas: Used for exploratory data analysis, enabling a deep dive into the dataset to uncover key trends and patterns.
- Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization, providing a graphical representation of the analysis, making it easier to interpret and understand.
- Scikit-learn: Utilized for clustering machine learning models, aiding in the identification of patterns and relationships within the data.
- SQL Scripts: Written to facilitate the integration of data from various sources, ensuring a cohesive and unified dataset for analysis.
- Power BI: Used for the final presentation and visualization of the results, offering an interactive and engaging way to display the findings.

The combination of these tools and techniques allowed for a thorough and insightful analysis of the fashion retail data, ultimately aimed at driving informed decision-making for the company.

## Aim and Objectives
- To perform data cleaning and pre-processing.
-	To merge the two datasets.
-	To identify customer behaviour based on culture.
-	To identify customer preferences based on colour.
-	To identify customer preferences based on price.
-	To identify customer preferences based on brand.
-	To build a machine learning model that can aid in the identification of patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Insights
Upon examining the customers' preferences, the analysis of the top 10 colours revealed a clear trend; black emerges as the most sought-after hue, and yellow occupies the position of least popularity. This suggests that black is an enduring colour choice for clothing items, indicating that virtually everyone has at least a black colour of choice garment in their wardrobe
